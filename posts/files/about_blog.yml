   Welcome!

   This is a blog of meditations on software engineering matters.

   By "meditations" I mean the posts themselves will be meditative. That is, for the reader and the writer, the posts are explorations that seek depth and clarity.

   And by "software engineering", I mean all of
      (1)  languages, data structures, and algorithms
      (2)  software architecture
      (3)  design philosophies and practices
      (4)  business concerns
