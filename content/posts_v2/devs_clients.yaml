title: Who are your Clients?

        Like all writers, a programmer must ask "Who am I writing for?" Often there are multiple audiences which the developer must take into consideration.

        THE END USER: Will my changes satisfy the user of my software?

        FUTURE DEVS: Is your code clear and easy to modify for future developers on your project? That list of future developers includes you!

        THE ORGANIZATION: It's not only the customers and software developers who need good code. Every worthwhile change to software, improves the business or organization which owns that software.

        YOURSELF (NOW): Code isn't just a result. It's a process. Does your code that you are currently writing clarify your thinking about a problem?

        It is not easy to properly write for all the clients who will use it. Yet good programers take into account all of their audiences at once. I will write a series of posts describing these points in detail. This in turn will introduce a longer discussion of the traits of good software.
